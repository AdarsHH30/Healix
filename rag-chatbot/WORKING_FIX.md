# 🚨 IMMEDIATE WORKING FIX

Your chatbot deployed but has dependency issues. Here's the **working version**:

## 🔧 **Quick Fix - Update Render Dashboard:**

**Change Start Command to:**
```bash
gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 60 src.app-working:app
```

**Keep Build Command as:**
```bash
./build-minimal.sh
```

## 📝 **Git Commands:**

```bash
# Add the working version
git add src/app-working.py Procfile-working

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Add working app without dependency issues"

# Deploy
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 **Test After Update:**

```bash
# Health check (should work)
curl https://first-aid-2ubv.onrender.com/health

# Test first aid question
curl -X POST https://first-aid-2ubv.onrender.com/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What should I do for a burn?"}'
```

## ✅ **What This Fixes:**

- **Removes all LangChain dependencies** (causing the import errors)
- **Pure Groq API integration** (no middleware)
- **Comprehensive first aid knowledge base** (built-in)
- **Works with minimal requirements** (only flask, groq, etc.)

## 🎯 **Expected Response:**

After updating the start command, you should get proper responses like:

```json
{
  "query": "What should I do for a burn?",
  "answer": "For burns: 1. Cool with running water for 10-20 minutes...",
  "source": "first_aid_knowledge_base",
  "mode": "groq_direct"
}
```

**Update the Start Command now and redeploy!** 🚀
